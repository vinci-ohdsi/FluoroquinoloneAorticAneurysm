<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method performs the entire cohort incidence analysis in one step without the need for creating any permenant tables.
</p>
<p>The process for calculating the cohort incidence is as follows:
- Create the time at risk episodes from the target cohorts, using the specified startWith, endWith and offsets
- Calculate the excluded time by finding the overlap of TAR with the following:
- 1. Outcome cohort episodes (adding the clean window to each outcome episode end date)
- 2. Exclusion cohort that was specified in the outcome definition excludeCohortId.
- Count the distinct persons, distinct persons with cases, total time at risk and total cases, and calcuate the proportion and rates.
</p>
<p>The resuting dataframe is described with the following table:
|Name |Description|
|&mdash;&ndash;|&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;|
|REF_ID|The reference id specified in buildOptions() to track results to the analysis execution.|
|SOURCE_NAME|The name of the source for these results|
|TARGET_COHORT_DEFIITION_ID|The cohort ID of the target population|
|TARGET_NAME|The name of the target cohort|
|TAR_ID|The TAR identifier|
|TAR_START_WITH|Indicates if the TAR starts with the 'start' or 'end' of the target cohort episode|
|TAR_START_OFFSET|The days added to the date field specified in TAR_START_WITH|
|TAR_END_WITH|Indicates if the TAR ends with the 'start' or 'end' of the target cohort episode|
|TAR_END_OFFSET|The days added to the date field specified in TAR_END_WITH|
|SUBGROUP_ID|The subgroup identifier|
|SUBGROUP_NAME|The name of the subgroup|
|OUTCOME_ID|The outcome identifier|
|OUTCOME_COHORT_DEFINITION_ID|The cohort ID of the outcome population|

|PERSON_DAYS|Total TAR (in days) after excluded time was removed from TAR.|
|PERSON_OUTCOMES_PE|Distinct persons with outcome before removing excluded time from TAR|
|PERSON_OUTCOMES|Distinct persons with outcome after removing excluded time from TAR.  A person must have at least 1 day TAR to be included.|
|OUTCOMES_PE|Number of cases before excluding TAR.|
|OUTCOMES|Number of cases after excluding TAR.|
|INCIDENCE_PROPORTION_P100P|The Incidence Proportion (per 100 people), calculated by person_outcomes / persons_at_risk * 100|
|INCIDENCE_RATE_P100PY|The Incidence Rate (per 100 person years), calculated by outcomes / person_days / 365.25 * 100|
